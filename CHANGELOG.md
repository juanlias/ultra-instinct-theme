# Change Log

All notable changes to the "ultra-instinct-theme" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **Premium Terminal Integration**: The integrated terminal now uses the theme's exact color palette (ANSI colors custom-mapped to theme accents).
- **Focus Mode**: Breadcrumbs and File Tree are dimmed/ghosted when not in use to reduce visual noise.
- **Search Glow**: Find/Replace matches now have a distinct accent-colored border for better visibility.
- **Brilliant Active Tabs**: Active tab text is now set to high-saturation "Neon" colors (Mastered `#E080FF`, Sign `#448AFF`, Light `#A855F7`) for maximum pop.

### Changed

- **Dark Mastered Overhaul**:
  - Replaced clashing Cyan (`#00EAFF`) with a harmonious Purple/Silver hierarchy.
  - Updated JSON keys, variables, and attributes to soft blue/purple.
  - Fixed Boolean/Numeric values to use the theme's accent purple (`#7B42FF`).
- **Window Focus Refinement**: Softened the `titleBar.activeForeground` across all themes to remove the harsh "white" contrast, creating a more elegant active state.
- **Active Tab Readability**: Removed the background tint from active tabs in all themes. Active state is now purely defined by the vibrant text and top border.
- **General Polish**: Unified widget borders, shadows, and list selection styles across all three themes.
